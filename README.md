In this project, a mesh network has been created for published data from several sensors that are placed separately from each other in order to reach to the System on Chip (SoC) in the house that is acting as a server. These sensor data will then be published to the mobile application that is connected to the server via Websocket. I choosed Raspberry PI 3 as SoC because of it's cheap price. painlessMesh library is used for creating the mesh network. NodeMCU IoT platform is used for the nodes in mesh network. Mobile application connects to the server using it's local IP address in WiFi network. Communication between root node and server is done by using ROS. Root node sends all sensor data from child nodes via ROS Serial library. Root node is connected to the server via physical cable. Reason of this is NodeMCU being unable to connect more than one WiFi network. (Meanwhile painlessMesh itself creates an access point, ROS Serial library attempts to connect to an exist WiFi network. This causes these two library to conflict with each other.) Mobile application is developed using Xamarin Forms to be cross-platform application.
